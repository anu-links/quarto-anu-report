# Quarto template for ANU Report

This repository contains the Quarto template for ANU report.

## Installing

``` bash
quarto use template anu-links/quarto-anu-report
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you
can use as a starting place for your report.

## Format Options

There are three formats available: pdf, html and docx. The docx only
contains the styles.

### `anu-report-html`

### `anu-report-pdf`

[![](examples/template-pdf.png)](examples/template.pdf)

### `anu-report-docx`

This docx file mimics the style format supplied for the docx report
template from the [ANU Brand Identity
Hub](https://anu365.sharepoint.com/sites/ANUidentityHUB). Currently, it
only copies the style and not the formatting (title page, footer, etc)
so it is recommended that you copy the output to the docx template
provided by the ANU Brand Identity Hub. See also
